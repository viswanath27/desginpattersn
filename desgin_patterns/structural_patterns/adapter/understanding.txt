    - This is like converting the interface of one object so that another object can understand it 
    - This is more like taking to different classes and ensuring that they support each other in data exchange 
    - 

Why do we need it 
    - This will be needed if we have code written at different times and want to adjust the code with some existing classes 
    - 

Where do we use it 
    - This can be used for continous update of adding new functionality to the code 

Problems and Advantages 
    - Some times we end modifying a lot in an effort of making this possible 

examples
    - Will come up with some of the projects where this is useful 
    - Will have atleast 5 examples for each one of this patterns
    - This can be used for different mechanisms to handle the data exhange for the S3
        - Meta data which is generally there for the storage remains same, but when it changes from S3 to some other storgae, this should be take care appropriately

Questions
    - What if we have multiple interfaces which needs to be supported
